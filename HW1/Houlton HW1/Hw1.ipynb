So, I am going to put some other import statements here that we won't need until later in the homework. Please install modules, as needed, using either `pip` or anaconda."

In other words, a colony forming cell \"... either give[s] rise to progeny like itself (\\\"birth\\\"), or [is] removed in some way (\\\"death\\\"), and these two events occur in a random fashion.\" This is often referred to as a \"Birth-and-death process\". They reasoned that a cell will give birth to another colony forming cell with Probability = p2 or to a differentiated cells with Probability = p0 (see panel at left). They further reasoned that if this model is correct, then simulations using the model must be aligned with their empircal observations."

In this method, the choice between occurrence or nonoccurrence of a random event is made by drawing a number from a table of random digits. Consider as an example the case in which the birth and death probabilities, p2 and p0, are arbitrarily set equal to 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. Let the six digits, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 signify a \"birth\" and the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9 signify a \"death.\" If the first random number to be drawn was a 5, then the model would show a birth, or an increase from one cell to two cells. Each subsequent choice of a number would determine the fate of a cell in a similar manner."
